What is GLP-1?

GLP-1 stands for Glucagon-Like Peptide-1, a hormone naturally produced in the intestines. It plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar) production. GLP-1 also promotes feelings of fullness (satiety), reduces appetite, and slows gastric emptying, which contributes to its benefits for weight management.
